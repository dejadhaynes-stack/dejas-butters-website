            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What makes Deja's Butters different from other skincare brands?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Deja's Butters is a proudly Black-owned business that specializes in organic skincare for melanin-rich
                    skin. Unlike many commercial skincare products that contain synthetic chemicals and aren't formulated with
                    darker skin tones in mind, our butters are made with 100% natural, certified organic ingredients specifically
                    chosen to enhance and protect melanin-rich skin. Each batch is handcrafted in small quantities by a Black
                    woman who understands the unique needs of our community. We never compromise on purity, and we're transparent
                    about every ingredient we use.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Are your products really organic?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Absolutely! All our base ingredients are certified organic by USDA standards. We source our shea butter
                    from fair-trade cooperatives in West Africa, our coconut oil from sustainable farms in the Philippines,
                    and all our essential oils from certified organic suppliers. We can provide certificates of authenticity
                    for any ingredient upon request.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Are your products specifically for melanin-rich/darker skin?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! While our products work beautifully on all skin types, they are specifically formulated with melanin-rich
                    skin in mind. We understand the unique concerns that come with darker skin tones - hyperpigmentation, uneven
                    skin tone, ashiness, and maintaining that natural glow. Our rich butters are packed with ingredients like
                    shea butter, cocoa butter, and vitamin E that have been used for generations in African and Caribbean beauty
                    traditions. They penetrate deeply to nourish melanin-rich skin, help fade dark spots naturally, and keep
                    your skin glowing without leaving a white or ashy residue.
                </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What does it mean that Deja's Butters is Black-owned?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Deja's Butters is founded, owned, and operated by a Black woman. Every aspect of our business - from
                    formulation to production to packaging - is guided by our founder's vision and her personal experience
                    with melanin-rich skin. We're proud to be part of the Black business community and are committed to
                    economic empowerment. When you support Deja's Butters, you're directly supporting Black entrepreneurship.
                    We also prioritize working with Black-owned suppliers and give back to our community through various
                    initiatives. Your purchase makes a real difference!

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How should I store my body butter?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Store your Deja's Butters in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Because our products
                    contain no synthetic preservatives, they're best kept at room temperature (below 75°F/24°C). If the butter
                    melts due to heat, simply place it in the refrigerator to resolidify - this won't affect the quality or
                    effectiveness. With proper storage, our butters have a shelf life of 12-18 months.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use these butters on my face?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! All our butters are suitable for facial use, though we recommend patch-testing first if you have
                    sensitive or acne-prone skin. Our lighter formulas like Tropical Paradise Coconut, Soothing Aloe Essence,
                    and Nature's Aromatherapy Blend are particularly good for facial application. They're non-comedogenic and
                    won't clog pores. For best results, apply to slightly damp skin after cleansing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Are your products safe during pregnancy?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Our pure butters like Golden Glow Shea, Chocolate Dream Cocoa, and Green Goddess Avocado are generally
                    safe for use during pregnancy and are actually popular for preventing stretch marks. However, if you're
                    considering products with essential oils (like Nature's Aromatherapy Blend), we recommend consulting with
                    your healthcare provider first, as some essential oils are not recommended during pregnancy.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do you test on animals?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Never! We are 100% cruelty-free and always will be. We do not test our products or ingredients on animals,
                    nor do we work with any suppliers who engage in animal testing. We believe in ethical beauty and are
                    committed to keeping it that way. Our products are also vegan-friendly, with the exception of our
                    Youth Revival Collagen (which contains marine collagen peptides).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How much product should I use?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    A little goes a long way! Because our butters are so concentrated and pure, you only need a small amount
                    (about a dime-sized portion) for your entire face, or a quarter-sized amount for larger areas like arms
                    or legs. Warm the butter between your palms before applying - this helps it melt and absorb more easily.
                    Our 4oz jars typically last 2-3 months with daily use.

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is your return policy?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    We want you to love your Deja's Butters! If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can
                    return unused products within 30 days for a full refund. Due to the nature of skincare products, we cannot

                    order, please contact us at contact@dejasbutters.com and we'll make it right.
