            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    Welcome to Deja's Butters, a proudly Black-owned business where skincare meets soul care. What started
                    as a personal journey to find pure, effective skincare for melanin-rich skin has blossomed into a mission
                    to bring the healing power of nature to our community and beyond.
                </p>

                <h2>A Black Woman's Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Deja's Butters was born from a simple realization: melanin-rich skin deserves better than synthetic chemicals
                    and mysterious ingredients we can't pronounce. As a Black woman, our founder Deja struggled to find skincare
                    products that truly understood and celebrated darker skin tones. Too often, the beauty industry overlooks
                    our unique needs - from hyperpigmentation concerns to the natural glow that our skin possesses when properly
                    nourished.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After being disappointed by commercial products that either weren't formulated for us or contained harsh
                    additives that did more harm than good, Deja embarked on a journey to create something different - something
                    pure, natural, and specifically crafted to enhance the beauty of melanin-rich skin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In her kitchen, armed with organic ingredients and a commitment to quality, Deja began crafting small
                    batches of body butter. The results were transformative. Friends and family who tried these handmade
                    creations couldn't get enough, and word spread quickly. What started as a personal solution became a
                    passion project, and eventually, a business dedicated to bringing clean, organic skincare to everyone.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    At Deja's Butters, we believe that what you put on your body is just as important as what you put in it.
                    Your skin is your largest organ, and it deserves to be treated with respect and nourished with the finest
                    ingredients nature has to offer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're committed to radical transparency. Every ingredient in our products is there for a reason, and we're
                    happy to explain what each one does and where it comes from. No hidden chemicals, no synthetic fragrances,
                    no compromises. Just pure, organic goodness.
                </p>

                <h2>Celebrating Melanin-Rich Skin</h2>
                <p>
                    Our products are specially formulated with melanin-rich skin in mind. We understand the unique needs of
                    darker skin tones - from addressing hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone to maintaining that natural,
                    radiant glow. Our butters are rich in ingredients like shea butter, cocoa butter, and oils that have been
                    used for centuries in African and Caribbean beauty traditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We know that melanin-rich skin can be more prone to certain concerns like dark spots, ashiness, and
                    sensitivity to harsh ingredients. That's why every formula is crafted to nourish deeply, even out skin
                    tone naturally, and protect the beautiful richness of darker complexions. While our products work for all
                    skin types, they're designed with YOU in mind first.
                </p>

                <h2>Supporting Our Community</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Black-owned business, we're committed to uplifting our community. A portion of every purchase goes
                    toward supporting Black-owned suppliers, Black women entrepreneurs, and organizations that promote economic
                    empowerment in Black communities. When you shop with Deja's Butters, you're not just buying skincare -
                    you're investing in Black excellence and supporting the economic power of our community.

                <h2>Our Commitment to Quality</h2>
                <p>
                    Quality isn't just a buzzword for us - it's our promise. We personally vet every supplier and test every
                    batch to ensure it meets our exacting standards. Our butters are made in a certified facility, following
                    strict hygiene and quality control protocols. We never rush production, never take shortcuts, and never
                    compromise on ingredients.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each jar of Deja's Butters is a testament to our dedication. We could make our products cheaper by using
                    synthetic alternatives or cutting corners, but we choose quality every single time. Because you deserve
                    the best, and we're committed to delivering it.
                </p>

                <h2>Sustainability & Ethics</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that beautiful skin shouldn't come at the expense of our planet or its people. That's why we:
